# Movie Trailer Website

I have written server-side code in Python that produces the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that store a list of some of my favorite movies, including their box art imagery, a movie trailer URL, and much more. The movie data is provided by [The Movie Database (TMDb) API](https://www.themoviedb.org/).
